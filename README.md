# Broadcast-Countdown-Clock
A simple Broadcast countdown clock written in python. It is designed to be ran on a low powered PC using a numberpad. It has a 6 digit number system, and has 6 keys that will each increment one number each.
In addition to the standard countdown based on an input, this clock will also change the color of the numbers based on time. It will turn yellow when the time is below 5 minutes.
When it hits zero it will turn red and automatically start counting up.
